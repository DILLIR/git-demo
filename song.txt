This is lind of song : la la
Some new lines
New one

And even more of song 
New lines in feature

The earth shakes and turns red,
The people remember this tragedy,
 
Is this the detroyer or the creator?
With the embers of hate, we swing the sword.
Is this our destiny or our will?
We will fight until the hot wind takes our wings.
